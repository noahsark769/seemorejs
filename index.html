		<h1>seemore.js</h1>
		<p>A lightweight jQuery plugin for easy collapse and expand of text.</p>

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>Simply download the <code>seemore.js</code> javascript file and include it in your project, then call the <code>.seemore</code> function on the query which you'd like to apply it to (see page source for example).</p>

		<h3>Basic Functionality</h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="span6">
				<p class='ex1'>When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin. He was lying on his back as hard as armor plate, and when he lifted his head a little, he saw his vaulted brown belly, sectioned by arch-shaped ribs, to whose dome the cover, about to slide off completely, could barely cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, were waving helplessly before his eyes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span6">
				<pre>$('.ex1').seemore();</pre>
